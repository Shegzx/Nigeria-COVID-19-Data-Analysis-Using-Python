# Nigeria-COVID-19-Data-Analysis-Using-Python
Data Scientist Microdegree Capstone Project

PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project is dedicated to analyzing the spread and trends of COVID-19 across different countries over time. By working with a comprehensive dataset containing daily case counts, the aim is to derive insights, visualize trends, and understand the progression of the pandemic globally.

Dataset Description
The dataset contains the following key features:

Province/State: Subregion of the country (if applicable).
Country/Region: Name of the country.
Lat: Latitude of the country or region.
Long: Longitude of the country or region.
Date Columns: Daily cumulative case counts for each country/region, starting from January 22, 2020, to March 9, 2023.

STEPS
Data Cleaning:
Handle missing or NaN values in Province/State.
Convert date columns to a unified datetime format.

Data Transformation:
Reshape the dataset analysis.
Aggregate cases at the country level i.e Nigeria

Visualization:
Plot trends of COVID-19 cases
Compute daily confirmed, recovered, and death cases 
Analyze economic growth patterns from GDP datasets.

DEPENDENCIES
The project relies on the following Python libraries:

pandas: Data manipulation and cleaning
numpy: Numerical computations
matplotlib and seaborn: Visualization
datetime: Handling date formats


IMPROVEMENTS
Future works to develop a web application to display real-time trends and incorporate machine learning models for outbreak predictions.
