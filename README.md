# Nigeria-COVID-19-Data-Analysis-Using-Python
Data Scientist Microdegree Capstone Project

PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project is dedicated to analyzing the spread and trends of COVID-19 across different countries over time. By working with a comprehensive dataset containing daily case counts, the aim is to derive insights, visualize trends, and understand the progression of the pandemic globally.

Dataset Description
The datasets used in this analysis include:

COVID-19 Case Data: Collected from John Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE) detailing daily cases, deaths, and recoveries.
Community Vulnerability Index: Measures the potential impact of COVID-19 across Nigerian states based on socio-economic and health system factors.
Real GDP Data: Tracks Nigeriaâ€™s economic performance before and during the pandemic.
State Budget Data: Details fiscal adjustments made in response to the pandemic's economic effects.

STEPS
Data Cleaning:
Handle missing or NaN values in Province/State.
Convert date columns to a unified datetime format.

Data Transformation:
Reshape the dataset analysis.
Aggregate cases at the country level i.e Nigeria

Visualization:
Plot trends of COVID-19 cases
Compute daily confirmed, recovered, and death cases 
Analyze economic growth patterns from GDP datasets.

DEPENDENCIES
The project relies on the following Python libraries:

pandas: Data manipulation and cleaning
numpy: Numerical computations
matplotlib and seaborn: Visualization
datetime: Handling date formats


IMPROVEMENTS
Future works to develop a web application to display real-time trends and incorporate machine learning models for outbreak predictions.
